imagemagick (8:6.8.9.9-1) unstable; urgency=high

  Obsolete config scripts (Magick-config, MagickCore-config,
  MagickWand-config, Wand-config and Magick++-config) are
  not multi-arch safe and thus have been removed from /usr/bin.
  .
  Moreover, these scripts are superseded by pkg-config
  facilities.
  .
  However as a courtesy to our users, these scripts have
  been moved to
  /usr/lib/$DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/ImageMagick-$VERSION/bin-$QUANTUMDEPTH/
  where $DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH is the multi-arch triplet and
  $QUANTUMDEPTH is the current quantum depth. $VERSION is the upstream
  version without the revision number.
  .
  Please note that these scripts will be definitively removed after
  jessie.

imagemagick (8:6.6.9.7-3) unstable; urgency=low
  
  Please note that imagemagick version 6.6.9.7 has moved its global 
  configuration files from /usr/share/imagemagick to /etc/ImageMagick, 
  following the FHS. See the package imagemagick-doc or 
  http://www.imagemagick.org/script/resources.php for more information 
  on configuring ImageMagick.
  .
  This will lose any changes you may have made to these files, 
  in the extremely unlikely case that you have customized them (doing so 
  was not officially supported by either upstream or Debian versions 
  before 6.6.9).

imagemagick (7:6.5.5.3-1exp1) experimental; urgency=low

  The SVG, WMF, OpenEXR, DjVu and Graphviz coders have been moved to a new
  package, libmagickcore3-extra. In order to use some of these coders with
  Imagemagick you will need to install it (if recommended packages aren't
  installed by default in your system).
