logging
-------

The gearman job server is configured to log to a file in
/var/log/gearman-job-server/. However the default verbosity of the server is so
low, that the file may not be created until really bad things happen. 
The verbosity can be changed like other parameters in the default file located at
/etc/default/gearman-job-server
